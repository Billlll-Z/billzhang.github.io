In this paper, we presented an optimization approach in Federated Learning, addressing the trade-off between communication delay, energy consumption, and scheduling devices. We introduced a power control and a novel device scheduling, POLISH, to minimize delay and energy consumption while maximizing the total number of selected devices. The approach also integrates energy harvesting, outperforming a benchmark through experimental validation.

In this paper, we studied the effects of scheduling probability and power control in FL. We formulated a stochastic optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes overall communication delay and maximizes the scheduling probability
of each device under long-term constraints of fairness, power consumption, and battery energy storage. Using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework, we developed an algorithm, Sto-POLISH, which analytically solves the formulated problem to determine the optimal scheduling probability and transmission power for each device. The proposed algorithm also integrates energy harvesting, outperforming a benchmark in experimental validation by achieving lower battery energy consumption.
